journey:
  name: Basic GoL Sandbox
  persona:
    name: Alex
    age: 28
    background: Software developer curious about cellular automata
    motivation: Wants to quickly experiment with Conway's Game of Life patterns
    
  steps:
    - name: Visit Homepage
      action: Navigate to http://localhost:8080
      intent: Access the GoL sandbox
      success: Page loads and displays the application
      checkpoint: true
      
    - name: View Empty Grid
      action: Observe the initial grid state
      intent: Understand the starting point
      success: Grid is visible and empty (or shows a default pattern)
      
    - name: Draw Cells
      action: Click or tap on grid cells to make them alive
      intent: Create a custom starting pattern
      success: Clicked cells become alive and are visually highlighted
      checkpoint: true
      
    - name: Step Forward
      action: Click the "Step" button
      intent: Advance the simulation by one generation
      success: Grid updates according to GoL rules, generation counter increments
      
    - name: Play/Pause
      action: Click the "Play" button to start auto-advancing
      intent: Watch the pattern evolve automatically
      success: Grid continuously updates at set speed; button changes to "Pause"
      checkpoint: true
      
    - name: Clear Grid
      action: Click the "Clear" button
      intent: Reset to empty state for new experiment
      success: All cells become dead, generation resets to 0
